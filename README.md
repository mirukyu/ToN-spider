# Terror.moe xml site map
started as a way to get a list of all the items in the game, but I decided to expand it to include all the pages on the site. generated with spider and google indexing.

missing some enteries that are not linked to on the site and some that are not indexed by google.

some monsters/locations/items are no longer in the game.
